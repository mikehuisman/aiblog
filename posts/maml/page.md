# Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)

Deep neural networks have been shown to be extremely successful, yielding human- or even super-human level performance on various tasks ranging from image recognition to playing games (chess, go, ...).
Despite these amazing achievements, deep neural networks are very limited in their ability in to learn new tasks quickly (from little data). This makes them inapplicable in many real-world domains where little data and computational resources are available [(Hospedales et al. (2020))](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05439.pdf).
