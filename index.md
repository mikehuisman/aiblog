## Welcome to AI Blog!

Artificial Intelligence is perhaps one of the quickest moving fields in today's world. Keeping up, and understanding key research papers is not easy. We help you with this by creating understandable and in-depth articles that are much easier to understand.     


To begin with, together with Jan N. van Rijn, and Aske Plaat, I have written a [Survey of Deep Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03522). Check it out in case you are interested in meta-learning! 

The first blog is on its way :).
